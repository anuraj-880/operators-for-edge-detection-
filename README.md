4a .Gradient Operator:
Measures the rate of change in pixel intensity, indicating edges by calculating the gradient in the x and y directions.

4b. Roberts Operator:
A simple edge detection method that uses a 2x2 kernel to highlight diagonal edges by calculating the difference between adjacent pixels.

5a. Sobel Operator:
Detects edges by approximating the gradient in both the horizontal and vertical directions using a 3x3 kernel, emphasizing stronger edges.

5b. Prewitt Operator:
Similar to the Sobel operator, it detects edges in horizontal and vertical directions with a 3x3 kernel, but with different weightings for the neighboring pixels.
